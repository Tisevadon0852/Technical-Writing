## Introduction to Git and GitHub
It is common to become confused when learning the concepts of Git and GitHub for the first time. You might mistakenly believe that Git and GitHub are the same things if you're new to utilizing version control, but they're not.

After reading this article, you will know what Git and GitHub are, how to create and clone a GitHub repository, how to push your work to GitHub,Â and many other terminologies that are connected.

## What is Git
Git, often known as a "Distributed Version Control System," enables programmers to keep track of changes made to their codebases and collaborate with others. As a result, programmers may quickly compare versions of their code to see what has changed or go to previous versions. Git is installed on a developer's computer.

Linus Torvalds created Git in 2005, which has now evolved into an essential tool for software development.

## What is Distributed Version Control System
It is a software system that enables multiple users to collaborate on the same codebase while keeping a history of changes made to the code. In a Distributed Version Control System, each user has their own local copy of the code repository, which they can work on independently, and the system manages the synchronization of changes made by different users. 

## What is GitHub
GitHub is a web-based platform used  for version control and collaboration on software development projects. It allows users to store and manage their code repositories, track changes made to code over time, and collaborate with others on code development and management.

In addition, GitHub is also used by individuals and organizations to store and share various types of files.

## Why Learn About Git and GitHub
Learning Git and GitHub is esssential for anyone who wants to work in software development, particularly in collaboration projects. It is a valuable investment because these tools provide a powerful and flexible platform for managing code and working with others.

## Differences Between Git and GitHub
Git is a command line tool that is installed on a developer's computer, that allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously and it is used to manage code changes locally, while GitHub is a web-based platform for hosting and sharing Git repositories, and it provides a range of collaboration tools and features, as well as additional features like issue tracking, pull requests, and code review.

Additionally, Git is open-source software that can be freely downloaded and installed on any operating system, while GitHub is a commercial service that offers both free and paid plans, with additional features available on the paid plans.
