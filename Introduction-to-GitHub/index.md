## Introduction to Git and GitHub
It is common to become confused when learning the concepts of Git and GitHub for the first time. You might mistakenly believe that Git and GitHub are the same things if you're new to utilizing version control, but they're not.

After reading this article, you will know what Git and GitHub are, how to create and clone a GitHub repository, how to push your work to GitHub,Â and many other terminologies that are connected.

## What is Git
Git, often known as a "Distributed Version Control System," enables programmers to keep track of changes made to their codebases and collaborate with others. As a result, programmers may quickly compare versions of their code to see what has changed or go to previous versions. Git is installed on a developer's computer.

Linus Torvalds created Git in 2005, which has now evolved into an essential tool for software development.

### What is Distributed Version Control System(DVCS)
It is a software system that enables multiple users to collaborate on the same codebase while keeping a history of changes made to the code. In a Distributed Version Control System, each user has their own local copy of the code repository, which they can work on independently, and the system manages the synchronization of changes made by different users.
