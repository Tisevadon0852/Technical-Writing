After reading this article, you will know what Git and GitHub are, how to create and clone a GitHub repository, how to push your work to GitHub,Â and many other terminologies that are connected.

## What is Git
Git, often known as a "Distributed Version Control System," enables programmers to keep track of changes made to their codebases and collaborate with others. As a result, programmers may quickly compare versions of their code to see what has changed or go to previous versions. Git is installed on a developer's computer.
Linus Torvalds created Git in 2005, which has now evolved into an essential tool for software development.
